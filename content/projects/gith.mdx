# Installation

If you have Go installed already, you can skip to the [install gith](#install-gith) part.

## Install go

We will us [g](https://github.com/stefanmaric/g) here, 
but you can use other version mangers like [another g](https://github.com/voidint/g) 
or [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) too if you'd like, even tough I only tested with the first one.

To install Go, run:
```bash
curl -sSL https://git.io/g-install | sh -s
# or
wget -qO- https://git.io/g-install | sh -s
```

> [INFO] Multiple shells
> 
> You can configure multiple shells to add the environment variabls to if needed:
> ```bash
> curl -sSL https://git.io/g-install | sh -s -- fish bash zsh
> ```
> For more info see the [g README](https://github.com/stefanmaric/g?tab=readme-ov-file#shell-support)

I am developing at Go version `1.24.5` so `1.24.x` should work, but the latest go version probably too.

Now check Go is installed (you will have to restart you shell for that):
```bash
g list
```

## Install gith

Now to install gith, you only have to run: 
```bash
go install github.com/kurtschambach/gith@latest
```

You should now be able to run gith:
```bash
gith
```

Enjoy :)
